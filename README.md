## The Challenge

I faced, and still face, the challenge of comprehending how HTML and CSS elements, along with their properties, truly function. The content of the webpage was put together in the last hour, and I struggled to present the news effectively on mobile screens.

Despite extensive Google searches, watching numerous YouTube videos, and seeking guidance from ChatGPT, I have not fully grasped the intricacies.

Given more time, I aim to address the following:

- Optimize the site for mobile screens.
- Enhance the footer by incorporating relevant icons.
- Improve the navigation bar and links with captivating animations upon hover.
